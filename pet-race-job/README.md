#Race Job

Look at using https://github.com/esa/pagmo/ for race place

https://github.com/esa/pagmo/blob/master/src/util/race_pop.cpp is the code for the positions. 
We can update the C++ code to return the current racer positions, but we do not have the
distance between the racers.  Not sure how we can generate that.

Still need to architect
- racer position at data point
- racer speed at data point


## Data Import

`python pet_race_job/data_importer.py -d data`
